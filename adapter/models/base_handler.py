"""
Base model handler interface that all model handlers must implement.

This file defines an Abstract Base Class (ABC) that serves as a CONTRACT
for all model handlers in the system. Any new model handler (YOLOv8, YOLO11, etc.)
MUST inherit from this class and implement the required methods.

WHY THIS EXISTS:
- Ensures all handlers have the same interface (methods)
- Makes it easy to add new models without breaking existing code
- Provides type safety and prevents forgotten method implementations

    Abstract base class for all model handlers.
    
    This is a TEMPLATE that defines what ALL handlers must have:
    1. get_supported_tasks() - Returns list of tasks the model can do
    2. infer() - Runs the model inference for a given task
    
    Any class that inherits from this MUST implement these methods,
    otherwise Python will refuse to create an instance of it.
